#   CODE REFACTOR WORK
##  I was able to refractor an existing marketing website to make the existing site more **accessible*.
##  I focused on reworking the code by using semantic HTML element structure.I also consolidated CSS selectors and properties to make the CCS more efficient.
**Both CSS and HTML file are properly commented.
## Lastly,I was successful in creating a repository containing application code and deploying the website to a live URL without error.
