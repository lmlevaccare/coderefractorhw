#   CODE REFACTOR WORK
##  I was able to refractor an existing marketing website to make the existing site more **accessibility**.
##  I focused on reworking the code by using semantic HTML element structure.I also consolidated CSS selectors and properties to make the CCS more efficient.**Both CSS and HTML file is properly commented.
### Lastly,I was successful in creating a repository containing application code and deploying website to a live URL with no errors.
